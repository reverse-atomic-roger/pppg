A static website generator hardcoded for my particular needs. When its done enough for me to use, I may make some of the bits more flexible for general use.

The script will read a directory structure, and use this to generate the menu structure of the site. If it finds image files it will create a gallery. If it finds text files, it will attempt to generate an HTML page using the contents of the file.
